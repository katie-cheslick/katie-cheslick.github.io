I was fascinated by techniques like temporal biodiversity of crop species (as a way to cycle nutrients and interrupt pest patterns), intercropping, hedgerows, and livestock integration; marveling at the ways in which our food systems can more closely mimic the natural ecosystem, and thrive as a result. It gave me hope to learn how much of our global carbon emissions is the result of the food sector, and farming practices specifically, because this is something that we have the knowledge and power to change.\nSoils of California, taught by Iriz Holzer\nStatistics for Environmental Studies, by An Bui\nEnvironmental Economics, by Robert Heilmayr\nThis course provided a new lens for me, through which I could view environmental issues as part of a big picture—a picture of the world we live in, in which environmemtal health is governed by economic practices and economic opportunity. I learned how environmental issues cannot be separated from the capitalist system in which they exist, and how environmental issues which seem easy to fix at first glace are often complicated by the economic practices that drive them."

    "text": "Hi! My name is Katie, and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I studied environmental science, with an emphasis in physical geography, and was fortunate to take classes that broadened my interests, technical skills, and worldview. It was at UCSB that I discovered a passion for regenerative agriculture, through classes and fieldwork, and began working at a small off-campus farm. In the next few years, I aim to put my knowledge and experience to use by working on other farms that are guided by regenerative principles, and by getting more involved in the sustainable food sector. I aim to continue learning and growing in this field, and working towards a society in which our food system is seen as a solution to the climate crisis, rather than a problem.\nI am also interested in climbing, mountain biking, traveling, writing, and creating artwork. My passion for the environment and the outdoors guides all of these interests, and this is clear from the topics I write about and the scenes I portray in my paintings. I have created this webpage not just to showcase my educational accomplishments, but also to share a bit about this more personal side of myself.\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduation picture with friends (I am in the center).\n\n\n\n\n\nRock climbing in Santa Barbara, California.\n\n\n\n\n\nRock climbing in Bishop, California.\n\n\n\n\n\nSimply enjoying the great outdoors."

    "text": "About my art\nThis page showcases my artwork, beginning with a piece from 2020, when I was in high school, and ending with a piece from March 2024. My art tends to use vibrant colors, and is primarily made with acrylic paints. I am inspired by nature and the outdoors; by plants and animals, fungi, clouds, the way the sun creates patterns in the sky at different times of day. I am also inspired by the human body and form; the beauty of the way bodies roll and ripple, and change over time. I use art as a way to reflect and work through internalized societal notions of the female body as a sexual object, and as such, my paintings are a form of healing. I hope you enjoy, and maybe even find them healing as well.\n\n\nArt for purchase\nPlease contact me via my email (kcheslick48@gmail.com) if you are interested in purchasing a piece from here, seeing more art, or having a custom painting made.\n\n\nPortfolio\n“Beauty in the chaos.” Pen on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Electric life.” Colored pencils on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Sunflowers in the sky.” Acrylic paint and pen on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“In the midst of it all.” Marker and pen on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Pressure to conform.” Acrylic paint, pen, and colored pencil on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Garden of peace.” Acrylic paint on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Ocean.” Acrylic paint on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Harmony.” Acrylic paint on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Standing woman.” Acrylic paint on paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Mountain mother.” Acrylic paint on canvas.
