During my time at UCSB, there were certain classes which I felt were extremely impactful, as they taught me important skills and knowledge, and influenced my career path. Some of these classes, as well as the way in which they influenced me, are listed below. I have also included some projects, created during my undergraduate education, which I am especially proud of.

## Key Courses

**Agroecology, taught by Liz Carlisle**

While I had heard about regenerative agriculture before this class, it was lectures in this course that really solidified my understanding about what regenerative farming techniques look like, why they are important, and how they can be integrated into our society. I was fascinated by techniques like temporal biodiversity of crop species (as a way to cycle nutrients and interrupt pest patterns), intercropping, hedgerows, and livestock integration; marveling at the ways in which our food systems can more closely mimic the natural ecosystem, and thrive as a result. It gave me hope to learn how much of our global carbon emissions is the result of the food sector, and farming practices specifically, because this is something that we have the knowledge and power to change.

**Soils of California, taught by Iriz Holzer**

**Statistics for Environmental Studies, by An Bui**

**Environmental Economics, by Robert Heilmayr**

This course provided a new lens for me, through which I could view environmental issues as part of a big pictureâ€”a picture of the world we live in, in which environmental health is governed by economic practices and economic opportunity. I learned how environmental issues cannot be separated from the capitalist system in which they exist, and how environmental issues which seem easy to fix at first glace are often complicated by the economic practices that drive them.
