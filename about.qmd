During my time at UCSB, there were certain classes which I felt were extremely impactful, as they taught me important skills and knowledge, and influenced my career path. Some of these classes, as well as the way in which they influenced me, are listed below. I have also included some projects, created during my undergraduate education, which I am especially proud of.
