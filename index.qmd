Hi! My name is Katie, and I am a recent graduate from the University of California, Santa Barbara. I studied environmental science, with an emphasis in physical geography, and was fortunate to take classes that broadened my interests, technical skills, and worldview. It was at UCSB that I discovered a passion for regenerative agriculture, through classes and fieldwork, and began working at a small off-campus farm. In the next few years, I aim to put my knowledge and experience to use by working on other farms that are guided by regenerative principles, and by getting more involved in the sustainable food sector. I aim to continue learning and growing in this field, and working towards a society in which our food system is seen as a solution to the climate crisis, rather than a problem.

I am also interested in climbing, mountain biking, traveling, writing, and creating artwork. My passion for the environment and the outdoors guides all of these interests, and this is clear from the topics I write about and the scenes I portray in my paintings.
