This page showcases my artwork, beginning with a piece from 2020, when I was in high school, and ending with a piece from March 2024. My art tends to use vibrant colors, and is primarily made with acrylic paints. I am inspired by nature and the outdoors; by plants and animals, fungi, clouds, the way the sun creates patterns in the sky at different times of day. I am also inspired by the human body and form, and use art as a way to explore and work through societal notions of women's bodies.
